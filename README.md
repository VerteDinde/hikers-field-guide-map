# Oregon Hiker's Field Guide: Interactive Map

## Project
Oregon Hiker’s Field Guide is a popular website that allows users to find, update and categorize hikes in Oregon and Washington. Originally only for hikes in the Columbia Gorge, the site has since expanded to contain every hike worth knowing about for avid lovers of the outdoors.

However, the site (originally created in 2003) has no central database of these hikes, nor one centralized and visual map for users to look at. The result is a guide that can be very hard to navigate, and doesn’t provide an easy map to group hikes visually - for example, by difficulty or distance.

This map users to sort all of the Oregon Hiker’s Field Guide hikes by categories and easily view them on a larger map, with an accompanying description component. This would allow hikers to more easily find good hikes close to them, store data in an active database that is more easily scalable and edited in one central location (rather than individual wiki pages), and would let users favorite and mark off their own hikes.
