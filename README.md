# Oregon Hiker's Field Guide: Interactive Map  ðŸš€

## Project
Oregon Hikerâ€™s Field Guide is a popular website that allows users to find, update and categorize hikes in Oregon and Washington. Originally only for hikes in the Columbia Gorge, the site has since expanded to contain every hike worth knowing about for avid lovers of the outdoors.

However, the site (originally created in 2003) has no central database of these hikes, nor one centralized and visual map for users to look at. The result is a guide that can be very hard to navigate, and doesnâ€™t provide an easy map to group hikes visually - for example, by difficulty or distance.

This map users to sort all of the Oregon Hikerâ€™s Field Guide hikes by categories and easily view them on a larger map, with an accompanying description component. This would allow hikers to more easily find good hikes close to them, store data in an active database that is more easily scalable and edited in one central location (rather than individual wiki pages), and would let users favorite and mark off their own hikes.

## Usage
Coming soon!

## Data Source
Source data for this project was scraped from the Oregon Hiker's Field Guide. A scraper is in progress, and is able to correctly pull needed information from the site. Scraped data will need to be merged with an existing json file containing lat/long points for the various trailheads. Some manual cleanup/augmentation needed. 

Users should be able to sort maps by the following categories (example choices provided):
  * Hike Type: Out and back,
  * Distance: 15.8 miles round trip,
  * Elevation gain: 2500 feet,
  * Difficulty: Moderate,
  * Seasons: May-Sep,
  * Family Friendly: Yes,
  * Backpackable: Yes,
  * Crowded: No

Trails will be marked by their Starting Point.
